##About the Project

My love for puzzles inspired me to work on this project, I've always enjoyed the sense of accomplishment after solving a tricky puzzle, so I decided to create this 3D maze game to bring that feeling to others.
This project started as a portfolio project and has evolved into something I'm truly proud of.
